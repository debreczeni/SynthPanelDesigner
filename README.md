Synth Panel Designer is a free extension for INKSCAPE software. With SPD you can design Synthesizers an Electronic Musical Instruments UI combining over 140 parameters to create panels, knobs, sliders and professional grade scales.


# TODO

## SLIDERS

## GENERAL

# KNOWN BUG
* sometimes, when drawing a scale, if the knob or slider has been moved, the scale does not match the selection.
* sometimes the extension stops working, doesn't draw anything anymore and then it must be closed and reopened. Other times you have to restart inkscape.
